<h1>Hi.</h1>

<p>I'm sorry to say that we will be shutting down Dreamachines.ai on April 1st.  If you have images that you would like to save, please download them as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Last month, <a href="https://stability.ai/" target="_blank">Stability.ai</a>, which was our default image generation platform, suspended our account due to prompt submitted by a user that they felt violated their <a href="https://stability.ai/use-policy" target="_blank">Acceptable Use Policy</a>.  Despite the fact that there's no way for us to 100% screen prompts and the fact that we removed the offending user's account, Stability.ai decided to suspend our account without any possible recourse.  Private companies dictate their own terms, regardless of what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230" target="_blank">Section 230</a> might have to say.</p>

<p>So, as a result, we've decided to end the Dreamachines.ai platform. </p>

<p>If you would like to continue to use the platform, you can set up your own self-hosted platform using the <a href="https://dreamkitty.org" target="_blank">DreamKitty.org</a> platform but you will have to supply your Stability.ai / OpenAI API keys and web server.</p>

<p>I hope that you enjoyed using Dreamachines.ai.  No dreams last forever.  It was fun while it lasted! </p>
